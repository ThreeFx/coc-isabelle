# coc-isabelle

Because PIDE is not my editor.

## Install

This plugin (sadly) only works together with [neovim](https://neovim.io) and
[`coc.nvim`](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim). Install it using
`:CocInstall coc-isabelle` as usual.

If you are looking for a (far less feature-complete) and even more alpha
version, you are invited to use my [earlier Go-based
version](https://github.com/ThreeFx/isabelle-lsp). Note that it is still
neovim-exclusive.

## Commands
